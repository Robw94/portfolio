                >My name is Robert Webb, I am currently working as a Web
                Developer for BerryWorld based in Hertfordshire. My experiences
                are originally from games development, in which I worked on a
                commercial product “No Trace” that received industry and media
                coverage and resulted in being awarded the accredited “TIGA
                prize for entrepreneurship” for the successes. I have since then
                been more focused on front-end development using Angular, Html
                and Typescript although I go full stack in smaller projects and
                any personal projects.
